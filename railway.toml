# Railway Deployment Setup for Whoptix

## Step 1: Install Railway CLI (Optional but helpful)
```powershell
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login
```

## Step 2: Create railway.toml Configuration
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[env]
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Production"
ASPNETCORE_URLS = "http://0.0.0.0:$PORT"
```

## Step 3: Environment Variables for Railway Dashboard
```
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:$PORT
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Server=davidbaumann.pro;Database=dbayd5xzdn55n8;User=u41gecrgnxvqt;Password=skuvault_db_admin;SslMode=Required;Port=3306
```

## Alternative: Quick Deploy with CLI
```powershell
# If you have Railway CLI installed
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

This should give you immediate deployment without quota issues!
